# Admin: Bookings vs Training Bundles

Both live under the admin dashboard but serve different purposes.

## Bookings tab

- **What it is:** Training **slot requests** (venue + coach + time, single or recurring).
- **Flow:** User (or admin on behalf of user) requests a slot → appears in **Approvals** → admin approves/rejects → entry stays in **Bookings** for history and management.
- **Use it for:** Viewing and filtering all training slot bookings, deleting/cancelling, and **booking on behalf of a user** (by name or phone).

## Training Bundles tab

- **What it is:** **Session packs** (e.g. 4 or 8 sessions) that a user purchases. Each bundle has multiple **sessions** (individual bookings that consume the pack).
- **Flow:** User requests a bundle → admin approves and confirms payment → bundle becomes **Active** → user (or admin) books sessions from the bundle → sessions show in the bundle with **Attended / Missed / Cancelled**.
- **Use it for:** Managing bundle lifecycle (Pending / Active / **Completed** / All), marking session attendance, rescheduling, extending expiry, and viewing completed bundles.

## Summary

| | Bookings | Training Bundles |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| **Unit** | One slot request (one time or recurring) | One pack of N sessions |
| **Approval** | Per slot request (Approvals tab) | Per bundle (then user books sessions) |
| **Completed** | Not tracked as “completed”; you delete if needed | **Completed** tab shows bundles that used all sessions |

So: **Bookings** = who asked for which training slot(s). **Training Bundles** = who bought a pack and how many sessions are used/completed.
